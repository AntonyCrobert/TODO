Build a full-stack ToDo application using Node.js and TypeScript for the backend, with a clean modular codebase following senior-level software architecture principles.

ðŸ“Œ UI Design:
- Use simple HTML and CSS.
- Apply a soft pastel color palette for a calm, modern aesthetic.
- Ensure responsive design for mobile and desktop views.
- Design intuitive UI with clear buttons for "Add", "Edit", "Delete", "Mark as Completed", and "Filter".
- Use subtle animations/transitions to enhance interactivity.

ðŸ§© Features:
- Add new task list.
- Edit or delete existing task list.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Filter task list (All, Completed, Pending).
- a task list would be considered as completed if all the tasks in it is checked otherwise it will be pending

ðŸ›  Backend:
- Use Node.js with TypeScript.
- Apply modular architecture: separate concerns using services, controllers, routes, and models.
- Store tasks in a local JSON file to persist data.
- Expose RESTful APIs for the front end to consume.

ðŸ§± Code Practices:
- Follow SOLID principles.
- Modularize using Clean code architecture: UI layer, logic layer, data layer.
- Write clean, scalable code with maintainable folder structure and comments.

ðŸŽ¯ Outcome:
A clean, dynamic, user-friendly ToDo app that combines thoughtful design with solid engineering practices â€” architected like a senior developer would.
