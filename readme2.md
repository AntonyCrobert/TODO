Build a full-stack ToDo application using Node.js and TypeScript for the backend, with a clean modular codebase following senior-level software architecture principles.

ðŸ“Œ UI Design:
- Use simple HTML and CSS.
- Apply a soft pastel color palette for a calm, modern aesthetic.
- Ensure responsive design for mobile and desktop views.
- Design intuitive UI with clear buttons for "Add", "Edit", "Delete", "Mark as Completed", and "Filter".
- Include a section for displaying a motivational quote (static or dynamically fetched).
- Group similar tasks visually (e.g., by category or status).
- Use subtle animations/transitions to enhance interactivity.

ðŸ§© Features:
- Add new tasks.
- Edit or delete existing tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Filter tasks (All, Completed, Pending).
- Group tasks based on category or tags.

ðŸ›  Backend:
- Use Node.js with TypeScript.
- Apply modular architecture: separate concerns using services, controllers, routes, and models.
- Store tasks in memory or a local JSON file.
- Expose RESTful APIs for task management.

ðŸ§± Code Practices:
- Follow SOLID principles.
- Modularize using Cline code architecture: UI layer, logic layer, data layer.
- Use meaningful Git commits (e.g., `feat: implement task filter logic`, `style: apply pastel theme`).
- Write clean, scalable code with maintainable folder structure and comments.

ðŸŽ¯ Outcome:
A clean, dynamic, user-friendly ToDo app that combines thoughtful design with solid engineering practices â€” architected like a senior developer would.
